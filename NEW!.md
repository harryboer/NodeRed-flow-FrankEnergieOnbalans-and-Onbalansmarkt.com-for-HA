Nodes that are updated are:

- Prepare Get SmartBatterySessions Request
- Handle SmartBatterySessions Response
- Extract Sessy Trade Results

and then all the extra blue nodes that send the data to HomeAssistant.

one extra item is the node 'Zelfconsumptie plus' this is input from HomeAssistant where I made a boolean helper to indicate the batteries are running in Zelfconsumptie mode in de FE app. This then also published on Onbalansmarkt.com
For this you then need to set up thus helper in HA and add the relvant node in NodeRed and also use the updated code in node 'Prepare for Onbalansmarkt.com'
